# Project-1: Melbourne/Victorian Crime Data Analysis
## Introduction
Using data available from [Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/crime-and-justice/recorded-crime-offenders/2020-21#victoria) and [Crime Statistics Agency](https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-victorian-crime-data/download-data), we will highlight the top offences in Victoria for the last 5 years ending December 2021, focusing on Local government Areas/Suburbs, gender and age group to identify the key areas of concerns. This information will further assist our education sector, parents/guardians on what to educate the younger youth before they grow into a youth offender. 

Our aim is to identify:
1)	Top offences by:
    - Local Government Areas
    - Suburbs
    - Gender
    - Youth Offenders
    - Age Group
2)	Trends by year with;
    - Suburbs
    - Gender
    - Youth Offenders
